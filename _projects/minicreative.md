    **WordPress:** The most popular CMS on the internet today. My experience includes installation, pre-existing theme customization, and the creation of custom themes.

    **ProcessWire:** I recommend ProcessWire to clients who want a CMS that's simple in that it shows them exactly what they want to see and nothing more, and also to clients with repeatable content they want to update easily. ProcessWire is a brilliant open-source CMS which comes out of the box completely blank, making unique designs both easy and necessary.

    **Tumblr:** I've created custom Tumblr themes for clients who wanted a simple blogging platform that matched their website.

  description: "PerfectFit is a textile distributor headquartered in Charlotte, NC.
    They approached me to develop an e-commerce website which they needed in order
    to begin a factory-direct sales front. \n\nI suggested we work with Shopify and
    helped them customize a theme for their needs. However, with over 800 SKUs maintained
    in an Excel spreadsheet, such an endeavor presented several additional challenges.
    \n\nI helped PerfectFit organize their data in a consistent manner, and developed
    a tool using Node.js to parse and convert their current inventory spreadsheet
    to the CSV format required by Shopify for batch imports. I also created a hosted
    Node.js script which queries the Shopify API for new orders on an hourly interval,
    uploads a formatted CSV containing these orders to PerfectFit's server, and marks
    these orders as shipped based on CSVs generated by their current inventory management
    system. I assisted PerfectFit in deploying this script on a private Linux machine."

During the 8th grade, when a new restaurant opened in my hometown and didn't yet have a website, I offered them one for free so that I could do something practical with the rudimentary programming skills I'd been learning on my mom's computer (which only recently moved from dial-up to DSL). After completing several websites for other local businesses, I began to offer website design and development services in earnest, building my client base primarily through recommendations from small business owners who knew one another and liked my work. 

With each project, I learned more about the growing body of web standards and technologies, the aesthetic components of website design, the needs of small business owners, and the dynamics of freelancer-client relationships and communication. A strong initial desire to create visually compelling, one-of-a-kind websites motivated me to avoid template-based website builders and build each project entirely from scratch, which required me to foster an intamite knowledge of HTML and CSS and an acute attention to detail. What began as a primarily aesthetic practice quickly became equally technical as I realized most of my clients wanted domain registration, hosting, and a variety of other services taken care of as well.

Almost 10 years later, I continue to offer website design and development, both under my MiniCreative brand and otherwise. Through working with over 50 clients, I've gained a deep familiarity with the technology stack responsible for serving websites and a variety of popular and not-so-popular platforms for content management. I've also gathered basic knowledge about adjacent marketing fields like social networking, paid advertising and search engine optimization, and have provided consultation on a wide range of both technology and branding questions that small business owners typically have.
