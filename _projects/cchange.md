¢Change was completed for a software engineering lab during my senior year at UNC. Two other students and I were paired with a client from the Chapel Hill community who wanted an application prototype built. Our client wanted to create a social network that would encourage micro-donations by allowing users to post photos featuring an overlay of a charity campaign of their choice. "Likes" received by the photo would take the form of 5 cent donations to the charity running the campaign. The network hoped to transform the consumption of social media from a passive process to an active one, encouraging people to be vocal about the causes they care about and to learn more about new charitable causes via the platform.
