Hey, my name's Tomas.

I'm currently living in New Orleans, working as a freelance carpenter and handyman. I operate a large [community vegetable garden](https://montegutsycamore.org) with my neighbors in the 9th Ward. I have over 10 years of experience in computer programming. I grew up in North Carolina.

I'm fascinated by the concept of truth, and I like to practice a generous faith in humanity.

Many of my convictions are motivated by a belief that most of the world's ails are the result of the separation humans have constructed between ourselves and the rest of the natural world.

I'm using my website as an open inventory of the [things I'm working on](/work), as well as the [reading](/reading) and [writing](/writing) I'm doing, primarily as a way to keep myself accountable.
