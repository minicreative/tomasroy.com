Hey, my name's Tomas.

I'm a 20-something living in New Orleans, where I'm building homes and biking around. I grew up in North Carolina.

I'm fascinated by the concept of truth, and I like to practice a generous faith in humanity.

Many of my convictions are motivated by a belief that most of the world's ails are the result of the separation humans have constructed between ourselves and the rest of the natural world.

I'm using my website as an open inventory of the [reading](/reading), [writing](/writing), and [coding](/coding) I'm working on, primarily as a way to keep myself accountable.
