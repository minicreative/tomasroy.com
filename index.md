My name is Tomas (*toe-mus*)

I'm fascinated by the concept of truth, and I like to practice radical faith in humanity.

I am enamored with travel, primarily because I believe [motion is the most effective path to truth](/writing/motion-as-the-most-effective-path-to-truth.html). I like to hitch-hike, talk to strangers, sit on city sidewalks, and climb mountains.

I spend a lot of time writing code because it's fun and a bit poetic and I can use it to make a living from a coffee shop. I'm currently interested in food and community and the instances where they intersect.

I grew up in North Carolina where I studied computer science and philosophy.
