My name is Tomas (*toe-mus*)

I'm fascinated by the concept of truth, and I like to practice radical faith in humanity.

I'm currently living in Durham, NC. I'm spending my time [reading](/reading.html), [writing](/writings.html), and doing software development in RTP.

I'm enamored with [travel](/travel.html), primarily because I believe [motion is an effective path to truth](/writing/motion-as-an-effective-path-to-truth.html). I like to hitch-hike, talk to strangers, sit on city sidewalks, and climb mountains.

I've spent a lot of time [building websites & software](/code.html) because it's fun and a bit [poetic](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/69102-the-programmer-like-the-poet-works-only-slightly-removed-from) and because I've been able to use it to make a living from many different places. I'm on [GitHub](https://github.com/minicreative) too.

I've done a lot of thinking about questions related to [the mind](/writings.html?tag=psychology), [freedom](/writings.html?tag=freedom) and [the nature of reality and how we know anything about it](/writings.html?tag=metaphysics). I'm excited to do more.

I grew up in Waxhaw, North Carolina and studied computer science and [philosophy](/writings.html?tag=assignment) at UNC.
