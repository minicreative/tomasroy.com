My name is Tomas (toe-mus)

I'm fascinated by the concept of truth, and I like to practice radical faith in humanity.

I spend a lot of time writing code because it's fun and I can use it to make a living from any coffee shop on the planet. It's also an effective way to promote action and create new verbs.

I am enamored with travel, primarily because I believe motion is the most effective path to truth. I like to hitch-hike, talk to strangers, sit on city sidewalks, and climb mountains.

When I can muster enough discipline to stay in one place, I study philosophy and computer science in North Carolina.
