My name is Tomas (*toe-mus*)

I'm fascinated by the concept of truth, and I like to practice radical faith in humanity.

I'm currently living in Carrboro, NC, biking around, [reading](/reading.html), [writing](/writings.html), and making [websites](http://minicreative.net) and [sandwiches](http://nealsdeli.com).

I'm enamored with [travel](/travel.html), primarily because I believe [motion is an effective path to truth](/writing/motion-as-an-effective-path-to-truth.html). I like to hitch-hike, talk to strangers, sit on city sidewalks, and climb mountains.

I've spent a lot of time [designing websites & software](/code.html) because it's fun and a bit poetic and I've been able to use it to make a living from many different places. I've got stuff on [GitHub](https://github.com/minicreative) too.

I grew up in Waxhaw, North Carolina and studied computer science and [philosophy](/writings.html?tag=assignment) at UNC.
