It was always about words, or the lack thereof.\
\
I remember when you told me that\
the right way to smoke a cigarette was to\
bite the filter with your teeth\
and then I watched you do it.\
I remember standing in your kitchen\
with a bag over my head\
and no pants on,\
the time you brought your cello home\
and showed me the cuts on your arm.\
I remember sitting on a sewer grate with you\
and deciding something might work out\
with what was practically only a wide grin.\
I don’t suppose it was ever really up to me\
and that was my favorite part about it.\
\
Now I think I am nothing more to you\
than a character in a novel you want to write.\
Perhaps this is proof the same is true in reverse.\
\
In our eternal haste to express the inexpressible,\
sometimes nothing is better than to stick your face\
into someone else’s crotch.\
\
People like to talk about love\
and what it means to love a person\
and I am learning that loving a body\
is sometimes more loving than loving a mind.\
I have fallen in love with many minds --\
yet when I love a mind, I dissect it\
and build a new one.\
I pick out the pieces that fit into\
the puzzle that is my own mind\
and discard the rest.\
When I fell in love with a body\
and wanted to love it wholly\
I found that I need to learn\
to love the whole mind\
and that has changed everything.\
\
Yet I continue to drown in my own naivety.\
I know I am incapable of writing poetry.\
It was easier when poetry was\
kissing the soft spots on the side of your body.
