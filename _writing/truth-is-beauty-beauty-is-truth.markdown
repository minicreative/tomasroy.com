It is beautiful\
to conquer distance with a motor\
effortlessly, spontaneously\
to change surroundings and\
quench the mad thirst for novelty\
to access infinitely more of what is\
what, to me, might never have been\
if not for countless rivers of asphalt and\
a car to call my own\
but it is true\
that each cinematic car ride\
slowly contributes to the death of\
countless other “me’s” \
that clutch so tightly\
to the breast of the same mother\
whom my motor actively suffocates,\
destroying a world\
that to them might never be.\
\
It is beautiful\
to sneak from my room\
at 5:30 on a Sunday morning\
and thumb my way westward\
to ride shotgun with strangers\
whose words, by their mere improbability\
seem to glisten infinitely more than those \
of whose words I have relied upon\
and to seek thrills which smell of danger\
tasting the sweet fragility on the warm breath of trust\
but it is true\
that I left my mother\
alone in the house she raised me in\
to find the boxes she packed with glistening words\
half-opened and stuffed in the corner of my closet\
who must wince at the breath of trust she breathed\
as it howls icily back through the front door \
left ajar, and choke at reek of danger \
which she smells filling the vacant space.\
\
It is beautiful\
to see your legs curled towards me\
to press my nose into the place\
where your neck meets your shoulder\
and to wake to the sight of your eyes\
staring back into mine\
but it is true\
that when I face towards you\
with my own senses overflowing\
I am hindered in my understanding of yours\
and I may fail to realize\
that standing next to you and gazing\
into the world as you perceive it\
would be the far greater beauty.\
\
It is beautiful\
to hear you say I love you\
but it is true\
I am going to believe\
you are using these words\
not because they are \
beautiful\
but because they are \
true.\
\
Imagine - \
an other stands alone, wrapped in a beautiful painting\
unable to move, see, smell, or breathe\
the seeker of beauty will see the painting \
and gaze, himself satisfied\
the seeker of truth will first wish to peek below\
after which the other can be satisfied\
\
Perhaps then the two can more truly seek beauty\
together.
