After the combined influence of *Into the Wild* and *On the Road*, by the time I was fifteen I was dreaming of ways to escape what I understood to be the suburban prison of my youth, and to put major stock in the idea that because people were good and comfort wasn't that important, travel was substantially more accessible than most people thought. Below is a somewhat complete log of my more significant forays into the world:

* In June 2012, I bought 4 Greyhound tickets up the east coast for myself and my friend Cameron using a PayPal debit card that gave me access to money I made by selling old toys on eBay. We stopped in Asheville, Charlottesville, DC and New York and finished the trip at a music festival on the Hudson River which we sailed out of on Pete Seeger's boat, the *Clearwater*.

* In January 2014, after finishing my high school credit requirements, I snuck out my childhood home's front door at 5am and hitchhiked to Portland, OR across the southern half of the country. I quickly fell into the greater community of road kids and, after learning how to think like they did, accidentally hopped from one group to the next and crossed the entire country in under 8 rides. Significant visits included Athens, Atlanta, New Orleans, Denver and the Bay Area. The pinnacle of this journey was listening to the Decemberists' track *California One* while driving up its namesake, something I used to lie in bed and dream about in high school.

* In March 2014, I hiked El Camino de Santiago in northern Spain. 

* In December 2015, Cameron and I drove a converted minivan to New Orleans and lived downtown for a couple of days. This trip was sandwhiched by camping trips into the Blue Ridge Mountains in Tennessee and included trips  to Grand Isle, LA and Birmingham, AL.

* In January 2016, I dropped out of college three days before my classes started, sublet my room, put a mattress in the dying Honda Civic I bought the previous summer, and lived out of my car until my sister's graduation in May. This journey included a 5-week stint in New Orleans on an urban farming community in the Lower 9th, a week in Houston with the family of one of my clients, a week of backcountry camping in Yosemite, and a stint in Berkeley in which I lived with the homeless community in *People's Park*.

* In December 2017, I visited Montreal in a Prius with Cameron and our friend Stuart.

* In August 2018, I attempted to [canoe to New Orleans via the Mississippi River](/mississippi.html), starting in Minneapolis. The trip was cut short by a near-fatal accident involving a parked barge in the industrial area of St. Louis in which I lost my boat and everything in it.
